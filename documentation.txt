Gravity Forms Enhanced Tools - Documentation

Description:
Gravity Forms Enhanced Tools extends Gravity Forms with email domain validation and spam filtering features. 
It allows you to restrict or allow form submissions based on email domains and block spam using WordPress’s Disallowed Comment Keys.

Installation:
1. Upload the "wpproatoz-gf-extras" folder to your "/wp-content/plugins/" directory.
2. Activate the plugin via the "Plugins" page in WordPress admin.
3. Configure it by clicking the "Settings" link next to the plugin or navigating to "Settings > GF Enhanced Tools".

Requirements:
- WordPress 6.0 or higher
- Gravity Forms plugin (active)
- PHP 8.0 or higher (8.3+ recommended)

Usage:

1. Accessing Settings:
   - Go to "Settings > GF Enhanced Tools" or use the "Settings" link on the Plugins page.

2. Email Domain Validator:
   - Enable: Check "Email Domain Validator" (on by default).
   - Form IDs: Enter Gravity Form IDs (e.g., "152, 153") to apply validation.
   - Field ID: Specify the email field ID (e.g., "9") for validation.
   - Validation Mode:
     - "Limit to these domains": Only allows listed domains (e.g., "gmail.com").
     - "Ban these domains": Blocks listed domains, allows others.
   - Restricted Domains: List domains (one per line, e.g., "gmail.com\nhotmail.com").
   - Validation Message: Customize the error message (e.g., "Oh no! %s emails are not allowed"). Leave blank for default.
   - Hide Validation Message: Check to fail silently without showing the message.
   - Save changes to apply.

3. Spam Filter:
   - Enable: Check "Spam Filter" (on by default).
   - Check All Fields: Check to scan all fields for spam terms; uncheck to limit to email, name, phone, company, and message fields.
   - Entry Block Terms: List spam terms (one per line, e.g., "spam\nviagra") to block submissions. These update WordPress’s Disallowed Comment Keys.
   - Save changes to apply.

Managing Disallowed Comment Keys:
- Terms added via "Entry Block Terms" are appended to "Settings > Discussion > Disallowed Comment Keys".
- Duplicates are avoided, and existing keys are preserved.

Testing:
- Email Validation: Submit a form with a restricted domain email (e.g., "test@gmail.com" if "gmail.com" is banned) to verify blocking or allowance.
- Spam Filter: Add a term (e.g., "spam") to "Entry Block Terms", then submit a form with that term to ensure it’s flagged as spam.
