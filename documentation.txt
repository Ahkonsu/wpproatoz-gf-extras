Gravity Forms Enhanced Tools - Documentation

Description:
Gravity Forms Enhanced Tools extends Gravity Forms with advanced email domain validation, spam filtering, and spam prediction features. 
It allows you to restrict or allow form submissions based on email domains, block spam using WordPress’s Disallowed Comment Keys, and predict future spam using a custom database of terms and phrases from past spam submissions.

Installation:
1. Upload the "wpproatoz-gf-extras" folder to your "/wp-content/plugins/" directory.
2. Activate the plugin via the "Plugins" page in WordPress admin.
3. Configure it by clicking the "Settings" link next to the plugin or navigating to "Settings > GF Enhanced Tools".

Requirements:
- WordPress 6.0 or higher
- Gravity Forms plugin (active)
- PHP 8.0 or higher (8.3+ recommended)

Usage:

1. Accessing Settings:
   - Go to "Settings > GF Enhanced Tools" or use the "Settings" link on the Plugins page.

2. Email Domain Validator:
   - Enable: Check "Email Domain Validator" (on by default).
   - Form IDs: Enter Gravity Form IDs (e.g., "152, 153") to apply validation.
   - Field ID: Specify the email field ID (e.g., "9") for validation.
   - Validation Mode:
     - "Limit to these domains": Only allows listed domains (e.g., "gmail.com").
     - "Ban these domains": Blocks listed domains, allows others.
   - Restricted Domains: List domains (one per line, e.g., "gmail.com\nhotmail.com").
   - Validation Message: Customize the error message (e.g., "Oh no! %s emails are not allowed"). Leave blank for default: "Oh no! <strong>%s</strong> email accounts are not eligible for this form."
   - Hide Validation Message: Check to fail silently without showing the message.
   - Save changes to apply.

3. Spam Filter:
   - Enable: Check "Spam Filter" (on by default).
   - Check All Fields: Check to scan all fields for spam terms; uncheck to limit to email, name (First Name/Last Name), phone, company, and message fields.
   - Entry Block Terms: List spam terms (one per line, e.g., "spam\nviagra") to block submissions. These update WordPress’s Disallowed Comment Keys.
   - Save changes to apply.

4. Spam Predictor:
   - Enable: Check "Spam Predictor" (off by default).
   - Spam Predictor Threshold: Set the minimum frequency a term/phrase must appear in spam submissions to be blocked (default: 3).
     - Lower values (1-2): Catch more spam but may flag legitimate submissions (e.g., "contact us").
     - Higher values (5+): More conservative, reducing false positives but possibly missing spam.
     - Start at 3 and adjust based on your form data.
   - Save changes to apply.

5. Managing Spam Terms:
   - Go to "Settings > GF Enhanced Tools > Spam Terms".
   - Add Term/Phrase: Enter a term or phrase (min 3 characters, max 5 words, e.g., "buy now cheap"), set an initial frequency (e.g., 5), and specify a Form ID, then click "Add Term".
   - Edit Term: Update the frequency in the table and click "Update".
   - Delete Term: Click "Delete" next to a term/phrase and confirm removal.
   - Update Historical Terms: Click "Update Historical Spam Terms" to process all past spam entries for configured forms into the database.
   - Bulk Delete Terms: Enter Form IDs (e.g., "152, 153") or leave blank, click "Bulk Delete Terms," and confirm. Blank deletes all terms; specific IDs delete only those forms' terms.
   - Automatic Cleanup: Terms unseen for 90 days are removed daily.

Managing Disallowed Comment Keys:
- Terms added via "Entry Block Terms" are appended to "Settings > Discussion > Disallowed Comment Keys".
- Duplicates are avoided, and existing keys are preserved.

Testing:
- Email Validation: Submit a form with a restricted domain email (e.g., "test@gmail.com" if "gmail.com" is banned) to verify blocking or allowance.
- Spam Filter: Add a term (e.g., "spam") to "Entry Block Terms", then submit a form with that term to ensure it’s flagged as spam.
- Spam Predictor: Enable the predictor, mark entries as spam in Gravity Forms, add a manual phrase (e.g., "buy now" with frequency 5), test submissions with that phrase, and use bulk delete to clear terms if needed.
