Gravity Forms Enhanced Tools - Documentation

Version: 2.6

Description:
WPProAtoZ Enhanced Tools for Gravity Forms extends Gravity Forms with advanced email domain validation, spam filtering, minimum character length enforcement, and spam prediction features. It allows you to restrict or allow form submissions based on email domains, block spam using WordPress’s Disallowed Comment Keys with regex and pattern detection, enforce minimum lengths for text and textarea fields, predict future spam using a custom database of terms and phrases from past submissions, and customize common words to fine-tune spam detection.

Installation:
1. Upload the "wpproatoz-gf-extras" folder to your "/wp-content/plugins/" directory.
2. Activate the plugin via the "Plugins" page in WordPress admin.
3. Configure it by clicking the "Settings" link next to the plugin or navigating to "Settings > GF Enhanced Tools".

Requirements:
- WordPress 6.0 or higher
- Gravity Forms plugin (active)
- PHP 8.0 or higher (8.3+ recommended)

Usage:

1. Accessing Settings:
   - Go to "Settings > GF Enhanced Tools" or use the "Settings" link on the Plugins page.

2. Email Domain Validator:
   - Enable: Check "Email Domain Validator" (on by default).
   - Form & Field Mapping: Select forms and email fields to validate under "Enable domain validation and choose fields".
   - Validation Mode:
     - "Limit to these domains": Only allows listed domains (e.g., "gmail.com").
     - "Ban these domains": Blocks listed domains, allows others.
   - Restricted Domains: List domains (one per line, e.g., "gmail.com\nhotmail.com").
   - Validation Message: Customize the error message (e.g., "Oh no! %s emails are not allowed"). Leave blank for default: "Oh no! <strong>%s</strong> email accounts are not eligible for this form."
   - Hide Validation Message: Check to fail silently without showing the message.
   - Save changes to apply.

3. Minimum Character Length:
   - Enable: Check "Minimum Character Length" (off by default).
   - Form & Field Mapping: Select forms and text or textarea fields to enforce the minimum length under "Enable Minimum Character Field Mapping and choose fields".
   - Set Length: Enter the minimum number of characters (default: 5).
   - Save changes to apply.

4. Spam Filter:
   - Enable: Check "Spam Filter" (on by default).
   - Check All Fields: Check to scan all fields for spam terms; uncheck to limit to email, name (First Name/Last Name), phone, company, and message fields.
   - Enable Regex Matching: Check to allow regular expression patterns in Disallowed Comment Keys (e.g., "/\bviagra\b/i").
   - Enable Whole-Word Matching: Check to ensure non-regex terms match whole words only (e.g., "casino" won’t match "cassino").
   - Enable Repetitive Pattern Detection: Check to flag repeated words or phrases (e.g., "ShirleyShirleyShirley"). Set the Repetition Threshold (default: 3).
   - Enable Keyboard Spam Detection: Check to flag random, incoherent text (e.g., "dfasfasfs,gfyhsxyhzhzdfhyztded"). Set the Keyboard Spam Threshold (0.0–1.0, default: 0.8).
   - Common Words: List words to ignore in spam detection (one per line, e.g., "the\nand"). Customize by adding, removing, or replacing the default list.
   - Entry Block Terms: List spam terms (one per line, e.g., "spam\nviagra\n/\bfree money\b/i") to block submissions. These update WordPress’s Disallowed Comment Keys if the spam filter is enabled.
   - Save changes to apply.

5. Spam Predictor:
   - Enable: Check "Spam Predictor" (off by default).
   - Spam Predictor Threshold: Set the minimum frequency a term/phrase must appear in spam submissions to be blocked (default: 3).
     - Lower values (1-2): Catch more spam but may flag legitimate content (e.g., "contact us").
     - Higher values (5+): More conservative, reducing false positives.
     - Start at 3 and adjust based on your form data.
   - Save changes to apply.

6. Managing Spam Terms:
   - Go to "Settings > GF Enhanced Tools > Spam Terms".
   - Add Term/Phrase: Enter a term or phrase (min 3 characters, max 5 words, e.g., "buy now cheap"), set an initial frequency (e.g., 5), and specify a Form ID, then click "Add Term".
   - Edit Term: Update the frequency in the table and click "Update".
   - Delete Term: Click "Delete" next to a term/phrase and confirm removal.
   - Update Historical Terms: Click "Update Historical Spam Terms" to process all past spam entries for configured forms into the database.
   - Bulk Delete Terms: Enter Form IDs (e.g., "152, 153") or leave blank, click "Bulk Delete Terms," and confirm. Blank deletes all terms; specific IDs delete only those forms' terms.
   - Automatic Cleanup: Terms unseen for 90 days are removed daily.

7. Customizing Common Words:
   - In the Settings tab, under "Spam Filter and Predictor", find the "Common Words" textarea.
   - View the default list (e.g., "the", "for", "you", etc.).
   - Modify as needed:
     - Add words (e.g., "hello", "world") on new lines.
     - Remove words (e.g., "the", "and").
     - Replace with a new list (e.g., "a", "an", "to").
   - Save changes to update the list used in spam detection (ignored words won’t trigger repetitive or keyboard spam checks).

Managing Disallowed Comment Keys:
- Terms added via "Entry Block Terms" are appended to "Settings > Discussion > Disallowed Comment Keys".
- Duplicates are avoided, and existing keys are preserved.

Testing:
- Email Validation: Submit a form with a restricted domain email (e.g., "test@gmail.com" if "gmail.com" is banned) to verify blocking or allowance.
- Minimum Character Length: Select a text or textarea field, set min length to 42, submit with "abc" (should fail) and a 42+ character valid string (should pass).
- Spam Filter:
  - Add a term (e.g., "spam", "/\bfree money\b/i") to "Entry Block Terms", then submit a form with that term to ensure it’s flagged as spam.
  - Enable regex and whole-word matching, test with "casino" (flagged) and "cassino" (not flagged if whole-word is on).
  - Enable repetitive pattern detection, test with "ShirleyShirleyShirleyShirley" (flagged if threshold is 3).
  - Enable keyboard spam detection, test with "dfasfasfs,gfyhsxyhzhzdfhyztded" (flagged if threshold is 0.8).
  - Modify common words, test with "hello hello hello" (not flagged if "hello" is added to common words).
- Spam Predictor: Enable the predictor, mark entries as spam in Gravity Forms, add a manual phrase (e.g., "buy now" with frequency 5), test submissions with that phrase, and use bulk delete to clear terms if needed.

Notes:
- Version 2.6 introduces customizable common words, allowing administrators to define words to ignore in spam detection. It also adds regex support, whole-word matching, repetitive pattern detection, and keyboard spam detection for enhanced spam filtering. Version 2.3 improved field persistence and fixed rendering issues in the minimum character field mapping selector.
